## Horiseon Website

This project is a website for a marketing agency. This website helps potential customers understand what Horiseon does and make sure that the company fits their needs. Accessibility is very important for users and websites alike, so developers need to consider adding specific features to make sure everyone con enjoy the content. 

The site was missing some components that made it accessible to users, so I added them. I put in some alternative text for images and added some spaces in the HTML file so it would be easier to understand and to add some structure. I also added some comments on the css file to explain what each of the elements does and make it less complicated to understand and visualize the html elements that each modify.  

This site works with all browsers, it is not necessary to use a special software or app.
